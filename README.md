# Coupon Acceptance Prediction

## ðŸš€ Coupon Acceptance Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customers' acceptance of coupons based on various behavioral and contextual variables such as weather, time, age group, passenger type, temperature, and more.

A tuned Random Forest model was developed to achieve strong predictive performance, and an interactive dashboard was created to visualize key factors influencing coupon acceptance.
